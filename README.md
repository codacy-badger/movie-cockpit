# MovieCockpit
## MovieCockpit is an enhanced movie list for DreamOS receivers
- MovieCockpit (MVC) is based off of EnhancedMovieCenter (EMC) but has reduced functionality, basically focusing on recordings.
- MVC implements a two tier memory/sqlite movie cache which allows MVC to display the movie list with all it's information without disk access. So, no spinners or delays due to disks leaving standby mode.
- MVC imports all movies located in the E2 movie directories.
- MVC and EMC can run in parallel on the same box (just configure different start keys).
- MVC only supports DreamOS
- MVC is being tested on DM920 only
